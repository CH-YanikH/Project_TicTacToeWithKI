# Project TicTacToe with a AI
## Description
This project is a personal endeavor to create a TicTacToe game with an artificial intelligence (AI) opponent, allowing users to play against it. Developed during the first year of my training program as part of a project day, the game was built using C# and Windows Forms.

The TicTacToe game offers two modes: "1 versus 1" and "1 versus AI." In the "1 versus 1" mode, two players can compete against each other on the same device, taking turns to place their X or O marks on the grid. The objective is to form a line of three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before the opponent does.

In the "1 versus AI" mode, players can challenge the built-in AI, which has been programmed to provide an interactive and engaging gaming experience. As one of my early projects with C# and Windows Forms, it's important to note that the game may not meet advanced expectations but aims to offer an enjoyable and functional experience nonetheless.

Through this project, I had the opportunity to explore the fundamentals of C# programming and gain hands-on experience with Windows Forms development. Developing a TicTacToe game allowed me to practice user input handling, game logic implementation, and the integration of an AI opponent.

Please enjoy this beginner's TicTacToe game with AI opponent and keep in mind that it represents one of my initial forays into C# and Windows Forms development. Your feedback and understanding are appreciated as I continue to learn and improve my programming skills.
